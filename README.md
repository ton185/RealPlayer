# RealPlayer
Disables every FakePlayer check in every mod

## What?
Certain mods have checks for "FakePlayer"s. FakePlayers are for example, what mob mashers use to ensure you get player-only loot drops. Of course, many other things use fakeplayers.
Now, here's the issue: certain mod authors don't want fake players to produce drops from their mod. So if you use a mob masher for example, you won't be able to get their player-only drops. That's fucking annoying.

## How?
Pretty damn complicated, had to use transformers.
